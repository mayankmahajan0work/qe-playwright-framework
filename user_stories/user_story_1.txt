As a Sales Representative,
I want to create and qualify leads in Salesforce,
so that potential customers can be tracked and evaluated before conversion.


Acceptance criteria:

Scenario 1: Create a new Lead
Given I am logged into Salesforce Lightning
When I create a new Lead with valid mandatory details
Then the Lead should be saved successfully
And the Lead status should be "Open – Not Contacted"

Scenario 2: Update Lead status
Given a Lead exists in the system
When I update the Lead status to "Qualified"
Then the updated status should be saved successfully
