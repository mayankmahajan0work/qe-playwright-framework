As a Product Owner,
I want all customer records to remain correctly linked across Salesforce objects,
so that sales and support teams have a unified customer view.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a Lead has been converted and a Case has been created
Then the Account should show related Contacts, Opportunities, and Cases
And the data relationships should be consistent across all records
